# Projects

## I will be creating various projects and placing them into this repository, the ideas are from online individuals whose work I found interesting. This will assist me in creating my own visualizations as I am currently conducting my own reaserach and analysis for my personal project *Work Force 2024*.

### <ins>*Kings County House Sales Dashboard*: [link] (https://public.tableau.com/views/KingCountyHouseSalesDashboard_17122833261210/KingCountyHouseSales?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
This Dashboard I created by utilizing Mo Chen dataset and online tutorial. It collects house pricing of King's County located in Washington state throughout the years.  
*<br>1. Used excel  file Housedata dataset*
*<br>2. Used distinct Tableau tools*
*<br>3. The intent for the dashboard is to demostrate how size and location effect the house sale price in King's county between 2014-2015*
